This program is released for research and educational purposes and it is a basic version of the code developed for the paper:
F. Castanedo, J. García, M. A. Patricio and J.M. Molina. “A Multi-agent Architecture Based On The BDI Model For Data Fusion In Visual Sensor Network”. 
Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems. DOI: 10.1007/s10846-010-9448-1. So, please cite the paper if you find this work useful.

The code employs the annotated (ground-thruth) information of several cameras from the APIDIS dataset
and the obtained global result is plotted on the ground plane basketball court. 
It is developed using standard C and tested under Ubuntu Linux, it is no guarantee to work under other OS.
